 10  Handle system application termination attempts

Implements `applicationShouldTerminate` method inside the `AppController`
(`NSApplicationDelegate`) to (catch and) handle all application termination
requests (e.g `Quit` in OS X Dock). Application termination is delegated to per
window `close`/`quit` event handlers (or default window behaviour) via
`App::CloseAllWindows` (called with the `quit` flag set): application terminates
when/if all window close.

Without an `applicationShouldTerminate` implementation the application
terminates immediately (e.g. with `Quit` in OS X Dock) without permitting an
orderly shutdown and emitting any `close`/`quit` events.

Fixes rogerwang/node-webkit#430 and also resolves rogerwang/node-webkit#924

 25  Initialize Package earlier to evaluate commandline args earlier (fixes #1743).
On package initialization, flags from "chromium-args" are added to the Chromium commandline.
Previously, the Package object was initialized in the "PreMainMessageLoopRun" step.
As the GPU flags are already evaluated in the "BrowserThreadsStarted" step (which is before that), this was too late for flags like "--ignore-gpu-blacklist".

1px draw radius is unnecessary for nw and causes a 1px artifact at the corner of all windows
Fixes rogerwang/node-webkit#331

We create a mouse dead zone on frameless windows, because the drag handles are only available within the window border -- not outside (as the case is for framed windows). The if block was incorrectly only covering the dead zone on one side of the window -- not all four.
